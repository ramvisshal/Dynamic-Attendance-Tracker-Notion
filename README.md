# 📅 Interactive Attendance Management System (Notion-Based)

This project leverages **Notion** to manage attendance interactively with real-time tracking, categorized views, and automated reporting.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Daily Status Updates**: Track attendance for each individual with daily logs.
- 🗂 **Categorized Views**: Filter and view data by day, student, or attendance status.
- 📊 **Real-Time Performance Tracking**: Visual dashboards and progress indicators.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. A **Notion database** serves as the core tracker with fields like:

   - Date
   - Status (Present, Absent, Late, OD)
2. Use **Notion Views** to create:
   - Daily Summary View
   - Individual Student View
   - Attendance Overview (with filters and rollups)
3. Set up **Automations** to:
   - Trigger daily summary messages
   - Generate performance reports in real time
